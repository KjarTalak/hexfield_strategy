esp8266 hexfield game using RFID and RGB-LEDs


This Project uses an ESP 8266 Microcontroller to set up a Webserver to show the stats of Warhammer 40k Units, whose coded stats will be saved on an RFID-chip. The reading of the Unit-Stats happens through an MFRC522 and can be shown through neopixel LEDs on the board. 

this is an alpha version in early stage, so mistakes are common.
